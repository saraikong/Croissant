    Welcome to a page dedicated to croissant
  </p>
  <p>
    A croissant (UK: /ˈkrwʌsɒ̃, ˈkrwæsɒ̃/,[1] US: /krəˈsɒnt, krwɑːˈsɒ̃/, French: [kʁwasɑ̃] (listen)) is a buttery,
    flaky,
    French viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened
    laminated
    dough.[2] Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled and
    folded
    several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in
    a
    layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
